You will learn how to authenticate with Google Cloud from this Jupyter notebook enviroment and then use SQL and BigQuery APIs to retrieve a sample taxi fare dataset. Remember that your goal is to build a machine learning model that will predict taxi fares in New York City so that riders know approximately how much they will be charged before they take a cab. You will explore and clean up the dataset, prepare it for further processing, and will use Python along with libraries like Pandas and Seaborn to help you.\n",
