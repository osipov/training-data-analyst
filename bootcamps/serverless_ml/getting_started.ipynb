Keep in mind that browsers get updated all the time, so to have a predictable experience with the labs, your best bet is to use Google Chrome as your browser. Of course, you are welcome to try the private window feature of Firefox, or a similar feature in your favorite browser, but the labs may not work correctly when using the latest updates to non-Chrome browsers. \n",
